# FizzBuzz

## Instructions

FizzBuzz is a simple number game in which you count, but replace certain numbers with the words "Fizz" and/or "Buzz", adhering to certain rules.

Create a program that :
- Prints out the numbers 1 through 100, separated by newlines.
- Instead of numbers divisible by 3, the method should output "Fizz".
- Instead of numbers divisible by 5, the method should output "Buzz".
- Instead of numbers divisible by 3 and 5, the method should output "FizzBuzz".
